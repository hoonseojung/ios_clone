#  BMI Calculator

## Our Goal

The goal of this practice is to learn more about Optionals,  understanding of the MVC design pattern and to introduce the concept of Classes.

## What I created

I made a Body Mass Index calculator. Based on the userâ€™s weight and height it will calculate their body mass and give a piece of health advice depending on whether if they have eaten too many snacks or if they need to eat more snacks. 

## What I learned

* How to create multi-screen apps with animated navigation.
* Optional binding, optional chaining and the nil coalescing operator.
* How to create classes and difference between classes and structs. 
* Pass by value vs. pass by reference. 
* Formatting Strings. 
* Color literals.
