# Dicee

## Reason for selection 

The objective of this tutorial is to introduce me to the core programming concepts that will form the foundation of most of the apps youâ€™ll build in the future. This app will teach me a lot of important programming knowledge, while building a neat dice app.

## What I will create

I'm going to make a Las Vegas dice app. I can make the die roll at the press of a button. 


## What I learned

* How to clone an existing Xcode project from GitHub.
* Create links between the Interface Builder files and code using IBActions and IBOutlets.
* Get familiar with the Xcode code editor.
* Understand and use Swift constants and variables.
* Understand and use collection types such as Swift arrays.
* Test and debug your app with the Xcode console.
* Learn about randomisation and how to generate random numbers in Swift.
